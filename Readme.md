## About Me 👦
Hi, I'm Lance. I'm a first year student here at Purdue University majoring in computer science. Growing up in San Francisco, I've been fascinated with the growing tech industry in front of my eyes combined with my passion for computers and video games, I knew that computer science was something I wanted to pursue my degree in. My current hobbies are gaming, traveling, and coding. I am currently learning Java and working on a chat bot.
